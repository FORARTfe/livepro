I've constantly been copying one development folder or 
another, stripping the devel-specific logic inorder to 
start a new project. Therefore, I've created this 
app-template as a starting point.

To use this folder as a starting point, go to the parent 
folder (../) and do 'svn export app-template my-new-folder', 
then cd into 'my-new-folder' and 'mv app-template.pro my-new-app-name.pro'.
