LivePro is a collection of programs that use the common graphcis library in gfxengine for high-perfomance, low-latency video work.

Exmaples of what this does now:

- livemix
	- The main 'player' program (based on 'glvidtex' from another of my projects on google code, dviz/src/glvidtex)
	- This player is compatible the network protocal from gldirector in dviz/src/glvidtex as well.
	- Enumerates and connects to the physical capture cards present on the system and makes the available for monitoring via the network
	- Handles smooth crossfading between cameras, as well as making it possible for PiP and arbitrary overlays
- switchmon
	- Connects to livemix, automatically enumerates the cameras available through livemix, and allows the user to switch between cameras
- autodir
	- Monitors selected cameras (hardcoded currently) for motion and (attempts) to automatically switch between cameras as necessary to show the "best" camera
	- Controls livemix via PlayerConnection to perform the actual switching
- quietcam
	- Monitors a video stream (sent via gfxengine/VideoSender.cpp - e.g. any of the video feeds from livemix) for 'quiet' (e.g. zero movement)
	- Uses opencv's Lucas-Kanade point tracker, combined with running average of motion deltas to filter out static and osilating points in order to best calculate the true movement in the scene
- rxout
	- Receives a video feed via gfxengine/VideoReceiver and just writes the frames to a V4L-compatible video output
	- Designed to allow a V4L-compatible recording program (such as ffmpeg or mencoder) to encode the video feed toa file
- screencap
	- Capture a rectangle from the screen and transmit over the network via gfxengine/VideoSender
