ptzcontrol is a simple app designed to control a Pan/Tilt/Zoom head via TCP.

In it's present form, it's designed to send commands to an Arduino with an
Ethernet shield running the Arduino/PanTiltServer2.ino sketch. However, the
command protocal is both simple and easily adaptable. (Example command:
"115s" - Tilt to angle 200)

By itself, 'ptzcontrol' works just fine. However, it also can connect to a 
livemix server and display a video feed (assuming that video feed is from
the camera mounted on top of the PTZ head) and allow the user to 
click-to-pan/tilt on the video feed.

The 'zoom' control functionality is based around the idea of using a simple
servo connected to the Zoom control on the camera to zoom in/out. The
zoom command recognized by the Arduino sketch (Ex: 101w - zoom in 1 unit,
95w - zoom out 5 units) triggers the servo to it's "in" or "out" position
(configurable from the UI). The "units" (e.g. zoom in 1 unit or out 5) is
the length of time in milliseconds that the Arduino will hold the servo
at the in or out position - currently, one unit is 250ms, which I've found
to be the minimum time the the control must be displaced for my camera to
recognize the zoom action.
