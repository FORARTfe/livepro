AutoDirector

Simple Name, Simple Idea: An automated "director/producer" algorithm to control livemix.

The current algorithm in mind will be more oriented toward a classroom/discussion usage, where
any input /may/ be valid at any point in time. Based on motion anaylis, face tracking, etc, the
system will attempt to "guess" which camera has the most "important" action, and then switch to that.
 
For situations where there is little rating variance between cameras, multiple cameras will be shown
on screen. The layout used will/should be varied each time the transition from one->multi takes place.
E.g. each time a multi-layout is needed, it should use a different layout. Additionally, if
reliable face tracking can be established (or, LK tracking of features...?), faces could be shown 
individually.

A special mode shall be integrated wherein one camera (or VideoReceiver) shall be used for multiple
input rectangles, such as would be suitable for a screencapture feed from a video conferencing
software running on a secondary PC.

So, to boil it down:
	- Setup a moniton analysis object for each input feed
		- Generate some sort of "importance" rating
		- Divide video conf input into subrects, such as Rx1:0, Rx1:1, Rx1:2, etc
			- Analyze subrects individually as virtual inputs
			- What if we created a video filter that issolated a rectangle from a frame and fed it out as a new frame?
				- Could work, but what abouty applying it on the server?
					- Just set a video drawable with appros source rect or clipping
		- What about background segmentation?
			- OpenCV blob tracking?
					 
	- Watch each of the anlysis objects
	- Sort the inputs by their rating, group them by their deltas
	- Inputs with highest ranking and max delta from other inputs, shown
	- Lower ranked inputs, group together below
	- Inputs below threshold dont show

Things learned from Initial Impl:
- Need "weight" to "hold" the switch so it doesnt switch fast
- All cameras should have eyeline at same point in frame (for table cameras, not teacher camera)
- Either cross fade slowly or cut, no fast cross fades
- Need to fix the "cut thru black" and "fade thru black"
- After hold time, should we switch to the highest accumulated action...?
