LiveMix is the core of the engine. It handles the following functions:
	- CAPTURE
		- Capturing video streams from capture interfaces
			- Adjust capture FPS based on whether or not the stream is live 
			- Transmit preview streams to monitor/switcher controls
				- Scale down prior to transmission
		- QUESTION:
			- During capture, can we upload directly to the graphics card?
			- Why, how would that benefit?
				- Start the PBUF DMA copy earlier...?
			- Can we DMA all the way from the V4L capture interface to the GPU, no main CPU involved?
	- OUTPUT
		- Need to plan on being able to output to more than one independent output (same GPU) ..? 
			- What if system has two or more GPUs ?
			- Need to detect multi-GPU and manage uploading/sharing textures appros
	- REMOTE CONTROL
		- LiveMix is designed to run "UI-less" (no control UI)
		- Therefore, it must have an appros R/C API

	Bugs to work thru:
	
		- using switchmon:
			- tap on same cam (cam 1 in testing) goes thru black
			- tap on same cam (cam 2 in testing) goes thru cam 1 then blue again
