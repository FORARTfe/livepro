StageDisplay (SD) is a simple video feed display app, designed to be used for 
stage-facing screens.

Configuration is read from 'stagedisplay.ini' in the working folder.

SD receives a video feed from a 'VideoSender' (../gfxengine/VideoSender), (or
possibly directly from a capture card - future feature) and displays it in the 
configured location. 

A 'control' UI can be enabled which can be displayed on a second screen. The
control UI can be used to:
	- Add a timer overlay at a configurable location on the output
		- Start/stop/reset the timer
	- Display text overlays on the output
		- Configurable font, font size, background, position
		- Show/hide text
	- Blank/unblank the output
