To start out with, we'll make a simple network video monitor.

I hear you: Eh?

Really, what I mean is:

A program that shows you a grid of video feeds that are received over the network from:
- A GLVidTex player instance (e.g. monitor camera inputs)
- An MJPEG stream
- A DViz image output (e.g. poll DViz for changes)

That's all - just show the grid of video feeds.

Maybe once that's done, we'll add a simple click-to-switch interface - for now, just load and show.

* Why?
To wrap my head around the code and to get my feet wet - to see what the status of the code is.

* Update, Jan 20 12: More advanced monitor/click-to-switch app in ../switchmon
